Under app/ there are three applications,
      crs - simulator whose input is a workload model
      cws - simulator whose input is the workload trace
      cwsc - simulator whose input is the workload trace, but also outputs
      	   start time and finish time of the workload trace for
	   comparison.

To run the simulator:
1. Get the workload trace generated by the parser to a local path, say
   ~/dataset.
2. cd to app/cwsc/data, and then run "awk -f ds2wall.awk ~/dataset >
   workload". This will extract the workload trace from the dataset.
3. cd to the upper directory, and ./run.sh to launch the simulator.
4. The output will be saved to output/{metrics.txt,sched.txt}, which
   are the metrics and schedule, respectively.
5. cd to output/ and then run "awk -f ../../../script/job_makespan.awk
   sched.txt > makespan" to generate job completion times.
6. Run "awk -f ../../../script/pool_job_makespan.awk | awk -F"\t"
   '{print $1,$3}'" to get the pool-level average job latency.
