Efficient processing of big data has given rise to multi-tenant, big data clusters where multiple applications run on and share the same resources and data. Such multi-tenancy leads to considerable heterogeneity in the types of workloads, data sets, and users and their skills. This heterogeneity,
in turn, poses significant challenges for human operators of the cluster to tune the cluster to meet performance requirements that often conflict each other. In this paper, we use operational experiences from a large, multi-tenant cluster to discuss these challenges. We describe Colossal, a platform that we developed to tackle these challenges.
